<article>
<p>To truly understand tea, you need to know what actually constitutes a tea. There are three main categories of tea: true tea, herbal tea, and flavored tea. These teas are differentiated by the plants that are used to make the tea. There are also subcategories within each of these categories, to further make the distinction between different types of tea.</p>
<p>Many new tea drinkers are surprised to find out that herbal teas and flavored teas aren't really teas. That's because these types of tea don't contain any plant parts of the tea plant known by the scientific name Camellia sinensis. Herbal teas and flavored teas infuse spices, herbs, and flowers in water to make what's called a tisane. Read on to find out more about these different categories of tea.</p>

       <code><li>White Tea</li></code>
       <code><li>Green Tea</li></code>
       <code><li>Oolong Tea</li></code>
       <code><li>Black Tea</li></code>
       <code><li>Pu'er Tea</li></code>
    </ol>
    <p>There are three main types of tea. True teas are infusions made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. These teas are the traditional teas that were discovered thousands of years ago. There are five true teas: white tea, green tea, oolong tea, black tea, and pu-erh tea. These are the teas most scientists refer to when doing research on the health benefits of tea.</p>
    <p>Even though these teas come from the leaves of the same tea plant, they differ wildly in flavor, aroma, and appearance. White tea is delicate and airy while black tea is intensely pungent and bold. How can these tease vary so much when they come from the same leaves? The answer lies in the production process.</p>
    <p>Some true teas like oolong and black tea are oxidized. This process exposes enzymes in the tea leaves to oxygen, which results in a darkening of the leaves. Other true teas such as white tea and green tea are prevented from oxidizing. This results in a milder, more natural and earthy flavor. Here, we'll break down difference between the true teas.</p>

    <p>Herbal teas do not contain any leaves from the tea plant. Instead, these beverages are made by infusing spices, herbs, flowers, and twigs in hot water. There are thousands of flavors when it comes to herbal teas due to the wide variety of plants used to make infusions.</p>
    <p>Popular spice teas include turmeric tea, ginger tea, and peppermint tea. There are also hundreds of floral teas such as hibiscus tea, lavender tea, and jasmine tea.</p>
    <p>While the health benefits of true teas have long been researched by scientists, herbal teas have only recently piqued the interest of mainstream medical practitioners. Herbal teas have been used in traditional medicine such as Ayurveda for thousands of years.</p>

  <section id="Flavored_Teas" class="main-section"><header>Flavored Teas</header>
  <article>
    <p>Flavored teas are made by combining true teas with herbal tisanes. A true tea such as green tea or black tea is used as a base while herbs, spices, and flowers are added to create stunning flavor profiles.</p>
    <p>Some of the most popular flavored teas include Earl Grey and masala chai. Earl Grey is a popular British tea that infuses black tea with bergamot orange. It is a citrusy delight that blends fruity and malty flavors.</p>
    <p>Masala chai is a popular Indian beverage that combines spices and a black tea base. Typically, masala chai is made with an Assam or Darjeeling black tea and five spices: black peppercorn, cardamom, clove, cinnamon, and ginger. It boasts a spicy flavor that is evened out by the addition of creamy nut or dairy milk.</p>

<article>
    <p>The main compounds in tea are polyphenols, antioxidants, and catechins. Polyphenols make up about 30 percent of the weight of dry tea leaves. Most of these polyphenols are flavonoids and tannins, which the plant produces to fend off disease.</p>
    <p>Tannins are also responsible for the flavor profiles of teas. Flavonoids contain antioxidants such as EGCG, which have been credited with multiple health benefits. These antioxidants work to eliminate free radicals that can cause oxidative stress—the body's version of rust. This helps to prevent premature aging as well as serious neurological diseases.</p>
    <p>The chemical composition of tea differs depending on the type of tea and how it is produced. Teas that are minimally processed—white tea and green tea—tend to have similar amounts of polyphenols as fresh leaves.</p>
    <p>Teas that undergo oxidation—oolong tea, black tea, and pu-erh tea—have lower levels of polyphenols. That's because oxidation converts polyphenols into theaflavins and thearubigins. These compounds develop rich, robust flavors</p>
