    <p id="tribute-info">While already busy with his numerous restaurants, Andrés discovered a new outlet for his humanitarian interests in the wake of the devastating earthquake that shook Haiti in 2010. He went on to found World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit devoted to bringing food to people in the aftermath of natural disasters and other crises.<br>The impact of World Central Kitchen became clear after Hurricane Maria upended Puerto Rico in September 2017. Within days of the disaster, Andrés and his team had arrived on the island and rallied local cooks and volunteers. By November, WCK had prepared and distributed an estimated four million meals throughout the country.

        When the COVID-19 pandemic began shutting down businesses in 2020, WCK sprang into action with measures that included turning Mercado Little Spain and the Washington Nationals baseball stadium into community kitchens and food distribution centers. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, World Central Kitchen set up camp on the Poland border to feed refugees who had fled their home country.
